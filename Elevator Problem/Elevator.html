    <div>The Problem: Company ABC wishes to optimise its Lift algorithm wherein the inputs are:
    <br />1. Number of passengers waiting outside floor 0
    <br />2. Maximum number of stops/floors the lift can halt starting from Floor 1 till the last stop/halt.
    <br />3. The Floor numbers where the passengers wish to get down.
    <br />
    <br />The solution to this problem should take the above as its input and display the result as:
    <br />1. The optimum floor numbers where the lift should stop/halt so that the passengers have the least to walk further up to
    their respective floors.
    <br />2. The total sum of the number of floors that all passengers have to climb up/down for the soution.
    <br />
    <br />Note: There are no stairs from  Floor 0 to Floor 1. So The lift has to be used even to go to Floor 1.<br /> <br /></div>
    <div>Input Maximum Stops/Halts for the Lift: 
    <input id="stops" type="text" />
    </div>
    <div id = "PassDiv">Input Passengers: 
    <input id="passengers" type="text" />	
    <input id="submitPass" type="submit" width="25em"/>
	<div id="condiv"></div></div>    
    <div>
      <input id="submit" type="submit" width="25em" />
    </div>
    <div>Result:
