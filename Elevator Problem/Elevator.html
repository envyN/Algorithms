<div>The Problem: Company ABC wishes to optimise its Lift algorithm wherein the inputs are:
    <br/>1. Number of passengers waiting outside floor 0
    <br/>2. Maximum number of stops/floors the lift can halt starting from Floor 1 till the last stop/halt.
    <br/>3. The Floor numbers where the passengers wish to get down.
    <br/>
    <br/>The solution to this problem should take the above as its input and display the result as:
    <br/>1. The optimum floor numbers where the lift should stop/halt so that the passengers have the least to walk
     further up to
     their respective floors.
    <br/>2. The total sum of the number of floors that all passengers have to climb up/down for the soution.
    <br/>
    <br/>Note: There are no stairs from Floor 0 to Floor 1. So The lift has to be used even to go to Floor 1.<br/> <br/>
